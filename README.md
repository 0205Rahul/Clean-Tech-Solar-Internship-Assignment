# Clean-Tech-Solar-Internship-Assignment

In the Clean-Tech Solar Internship Assignment, we were provided with a comprehensive dataset spanning from July 2019 to the present. The dataset encompasses three crucial input features:

1. **Date**: This represents the timeline, ranging from July 2019 till now.

2. **PR (Performance Ratio)**: This key parameter is pivotal in assessing the daily performance of the Photovoltaic (PV) plant. A higher PR value signifies optimal plant performance without any issues.

3. **GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance)**: GHI measures the total irradiation received on a particular day. A higher GHI value implies sunnier conditions.
